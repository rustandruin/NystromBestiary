% in is a structure with (at least) the following fields:
%  -A, an n-by-m matrix, and
%  -k, the target rank, and 
%  -l < n, the number of columns to sample and
%  -qrlevscoreprobs, a 1-by-n vector containing the leverage score probabilities 
%  of A*A' computed using a QR factorization
%  -qrlevscorecomputationtime, the time it took to compute the leverage
%  score probabilities
%  -q >= 1 the number of times to repeat the experiment.
%
% out is a structure with the following fields:
%  -specerr, froerr, trerr: each matrices with two rows representing 
%  the spectral, frobenius, 
%  and trace norms of the errors in using q realization of the leverage
%  score based randEig Nystrom extensions of A*A'. The first row corresponds to 
%  Nystrom extensions where the rank was not fixed, the second to
%  extensions where the rank was fixed
% 
%  -timings, a two row matrix of the time it took to run each experiment 
% (i.e. form Q, W, Wk), including the time to approximate the leverage scores

% % if testing

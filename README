It is a collection of code for experimenting with various
Nystrom extensions.

It was used to produce the figures in the paper
"Revisiting the Nystrom Method for Improved Large-scale Machine Learning" by
Alex Gittens and Michael Mahoney (preprint available at 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1849).

Contents:
--------
the extensions/ directory contains the implementations of various Nystrom extensions
the io/ directory contains the code used to create, load, and process the datasets
the datasets/ directory contains the datasets used in the experiments
the experiments/ directory contains a set of m-files that actually runs the Nystrom
 extensions on various datasets and stores statistics on the errors and timing
the outputs/ directory is used to store the output of the experiments
the plots/ directory stores the plots of the timings and errors
the aux/ directory contains code needed in computing the extensions
the visualization/ directory contains the code used to produce the plots of the
 various timings and errors
the misc/ directory contains miscellany (so far, the code to generate the data
for Table 2 in the paper)

Usage instructions:
-------
(*ALL m files should be run from the base folder, otherwise you'll run into path issues *)
To produce the figures in the paper,
Short story, ensure that you are in the base directory, 'NystromBestiary',
and run the following commands from the Matlab prompt:

addpath 'aux' 'datasets' 'experiments' 'extensions' 'io' 'misc' 'outputs' 'plots' 'visualization'
create_bestiary_datasets
runall
visualizeall

Long story:
1) add all the subdirectories in this folder to your path
2) run create_bestiary_datasets to generate
 some required distance matrices; this step generates about 1.5Gb of data
2) run runall (or pick individual experiments) in the experiments directory;
 this step generates about 2.7Gb of data
3) wait several days for the experiments to stop running!
4) run visualizeall
5) the pdfs will be located in the output directory

See the individual m-files for more details. Make appropriate
modifications to substitute your own datasets.
